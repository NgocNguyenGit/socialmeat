## Social Meat
Everybody loves parties and delicious foods. But parties can be a big threat to food waste and sustainable eating habits. When the number of guests increases, there is a high chance of increasing food waste. The solution to this problem can be achieved if we gather personalized data of party guests' eating habits and integrate the aggregated data with HKScan's Agrofood system.

The Social Meat app, on registering, takes the user's eating habits as inputs, meat/veg preferences and taste preferences. Now when someone organizes a party, he invites all the guests through this app. After acceptance from the invitees, the organizer gets a fair idea about attendance, food preferences and capacity of intake for that day and can prepare accordingly. Also the organizer gets a detailed sustainability report of the party, how much is the carbon/water footprint value of the party, complete production process of meat farming and some sustainability tips on how can he reduce carbon and water footprint by choosing another meat item. In addition, to ease the difficult work of choosing a proper dish, the app also suggest some popular recipes from the chosen items. 

### Engagement
Guests can get a sustainable rating and ranking among peers for their food choices, enabling a gamification and collaboration process. Collect points, improve ranking and inspire others to do so, while reaching sustainable food habits, collectively. The app also engages retail partners and logistics to engage end users and gather more information about eating preferences while also ensuring a smooth supply chain.

### Scaling
While this app uses an use case for parties but it has endless possibilities to scale up to any size of events, students gathering, family supplies and even municipalities supplying food to hospitals, armies and anywhere where bulk supply is required.

### Communication in both ways
It's really helpful for the organizer to get all these statistical data about his planned event. But at the same time, HKScan is also benefited from the usage of the app. All the data about person's food habits, a party's tendency towards which kind of meat, available retailers near the event location are aggregated and sent to HKScan. Then this data can be used is endless possibilities, analysis information from this data can be used to approach the organizer and let them know more detailed information about the availability of meat products, choices of retailers and delivery information, other ways to be more sustainable etc. to name a few.

### Improvement Scope
We have plans to integrate barcode scanning feature in the app. While in a store, you can scan the barcode on a meat package and instantly get to know the whole timeline of production from HKScan's data. From farming to packaging, you can get a series of operations and farm monitoring data collected periodically.
